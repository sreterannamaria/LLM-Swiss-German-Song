# Fine-Tuning Large Language Models for Swiss German Song Generation

This repository contains the code and training pipeline for a research project focused on fine-tuning a pre-trained LLM (Recurrent Neural Network with GRUs) to generate lyrics in the **Bernese dialect of Swiss German**.

The goal of this project was to explore whether large language models can generate culturally meaningful and coherent text in underrepresented dialects, using Swiss German song lyrics as a case study.

## Project Context

This work was conducted as part of a **Master's research project** at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts (HSLU) and the Fernfachhochschule Schweiz (FFHS) in 2024.

## Overview

- **Language Focus:** Bernese dialect of Swiss German  
- **Model Architecture:** Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with GRU cells  
- **Frameworks:** TensorFlow Â· Keras Â· Python 3  
- **Tasks Covered:**  
  - Custom dataset curation  
  - Preprocessing (tokenization, standardization)  
  - Model fine-tuning  
  - Output generation  
  - Evaluation based on perplexity and human review

## Key Findings

- Successful adaptation of a GRU-based model to a low-resource dialect  
- Generated lyrics were partially coherent and stylistically aligned with dialect norms  
- Challenges included data scarcity and dialect-specific token variability  
- The project demonstrates potential for LLM-based text generation in underrepresented linguistic contexts
